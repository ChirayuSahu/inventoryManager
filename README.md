# Inventory Manager

Inventory Manager made using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Firebase. This is my first ever project created with Next.js.

## Project Description

This Inventory Manager application is designed to help users manage their inventory efficiently. It leverages the power of Next.js for server-side rendering, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Firebase for backend services.

## Features

- **Real-time Inventory Tracking**: Keep track of your inventory levels in real-time.
- **User Authentication**: Secure user authentication using Firebase.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly design using Tailwind CSS.
- **Data Persistence**: Persistent data storage with Firebase Firestore.
- **Easy Deployment**: Deployed on Vercel for seamless CI/CD.

## Getting Started

First, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChirayuSahu/inventoryManager.git
cd inventoryManager
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
